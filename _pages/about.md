Hi! I'm **Saif Mahmud**, a **PhD Student, Computer Science, University of Texas at Arlington**. I have completed my **MSCS** from **The University of Texas at El Paso**. My research motivation lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and **Explainable AI**. I enjoy building tools that make code more reliable and developers more productive. During my graduate studies, I have created software quality attributes datasets and code smell datasets to help train various machine learning models to detect code smells. Currently, I am focusing on detecting llm generated code and how they are different from the human counterparts.
